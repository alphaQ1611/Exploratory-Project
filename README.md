### Tools Required

Python 2.7 is used during development and following libraries are required to run the code provided in the notebook:
* Tensorflow
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas

### Dataset

The WISDM Actitracker dataset used for model training, can be downloaded from the following [[link]](http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php)

### Related Problem

User identification from walking activity. Accelerometer dataset from 22 indivduals can be downloaded from the following [[link]](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/User+Identification+From+Walking+Activity)

### Inspiration
Going through the [post](https://medium.com/@curiousily/human-activity-recognition-using-lstms-on-android-tensorflow-for-hackers-part-vi-492da5adef64), we decided it would be a good idea to try out as our exploratory project.
